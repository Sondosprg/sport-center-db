Project 1: Sports Center Reservation Management System
Context
A sports center offers various facilities (football fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, gyms,
etc.) that clients can reserve. The center aims to modernize its management system by
creating a computer application that uses a database to manage reservations, subscriptions,
and payments.
Key Features to Implement
1. User Management:
o Register new users (clients) with their personal information (name, surname,
email, phone number, address).
o Allow users to log in to the application using their account credentials (email
and password).
2. Facility Management:
o View a list of available facilities with their descriptions (type, hourly price,
available times).
o Search for facilities based on criteria (type, price, availability).
3. Facility Reservation:
o Enable users to reserve a facility based on available time slots.
o Allow modification or cancellation of a reservation.
o Send automated email notifications for reservation confirmations or
cancellations.
4. Subscription Management:
o Record monthly or yearly subscriptions for specific activities (e.g., access to
the gym or swimming pool).
o Manage subscription expiration dates.
5. Payment and Billing:
o Integrate a module to process payments for reservations and subscriptions
(online or on-site).
o Automatically generate invoices for each transaction.
6. Reports and Statistics (Administrator):
o Monitor reservations by day, week, or month.
o Provide statistics on revenue generated by facility type.
o Manage active users and subscriptions.

Technical Constraints
1. Relational Database:
o Main tables: Users, Facilities, Reservations, Subscriptions, Payments.
o Database: Use My SQL

Tasks for Students
1. Analysis and Design:
o Model the system using UML, including use case diagrams, class diagrams,
sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and deployment diagrams.
o Build the Relationship model and construct the database schema.
2. Implementation:
o Develop the core features of the application.
o Test key functionalities (user registration, facility reservation, payment
processing).
